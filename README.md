# PymFile

PymFile (Python Music File) renames all the music files in a folder to the actual title of the song from its metadata. 
Extremely helpful for organizing a lot of music files downloaded from the internet, which often have obscure file names. 
This program essentially extracts the actual title/album/artist/tracknumber from a song and incorporates it into the actual file/folder name.
Works by using Mutagen 1.3.1. 

HOW TO USE:
Place a music folder in the file directory as pymfile.py and execute the python file. This will give you a list of commands of what you would like to do. Type in your commands and let it do the rest!

UPCOMING:
-include support for more music files (Currently supports m4a,mp3,flac)
-make it more user friendly (Maybe a GUI)
-more options such as organizing by artist name, etc.
