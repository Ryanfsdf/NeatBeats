# PymFile

PymFile (Python Music File) renames all the music files in a folder to the actual title of the song. 
Extremely helpful for organizing a lot of music files downloaded from the internet, because they are
often named in different ways, making it hard to find the music file in a folder, even when using search.
Works by using Mutagen 1.3.1. 

HOW TO USE:
Place a folder with music files in it with PymFile.py and run it. It looks through every folder inside the main folder
as well and brings it all out to the main folder with PymFile.py in it

TO DO:
-remove spaces in the music titles
-include support for more music files
-make it more user friendly
-organize everything into album folders
